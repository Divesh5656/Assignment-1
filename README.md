# Assignment-1

I have chosen to do a Portfolio website for my project because portfolios will help keep and display collections of my work representing a selection of performance for others to view easily. A portfolio may be containing my best pieces and my evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the pieces.

## Design Process

Some insights about my design process, focusing on my future employers and clients view, it is for the future employers and clients of mine to have a easy and neat read about me, my skills and my past works i have done and my project is the best way to help them because it provides a convenient way for potential clients to view my work while also allowing myself to expand on my skills and services as i move up. But the ultimate purpose of my portfolio website is to provide a way for me to land more clients, whether that means freelance work, more clients for my agency or employment at a company.

list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I included a section about me, so that I can get future employers and clients to know more about me.
- As a user type, I included a section of my skills, so that I can get future employers and clients to know what i am capable of.
- As a user type, I included a section of my past works, so that I can get future employers and clients to know what kind of works i have completed and worked on.
